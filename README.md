**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Develop an algorithm for efficient task scheduling, addressing the needs of both
organizations and individuals, by optimizing factors such as task assignment,
profit , first come first serve, round allocation and maximum job schedule.

**FEATURES**

1. JOB SCHEDULING
2. TASK DIVISION
3. SEARCHING OPERATION
   
**ALGORITHMS USED**
1. Greedy Algorithm (for job scheduling):
   
The greedy algorithm aims to schedule tasks based on the
immediate benefit without considering future consequences. In job scheduling,
this means assigning the next available task to the available worker that
minimizes some defined cost or maximizes some defined profit at each step.

2. Greedy-Bin Packing Algorithm (for task division):
   
This algorithm is used to efficiently allocate items of different
sizes into containers (bins) in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.

3. String Algorithm for Pattern Matching (for searching):

 String algorithms are designed to efficiently search for a
specific pattern within a larger text or dataset. Common examples include the
Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, Boyer-Moore algorithm, or Rabin-Karp
algorithm.
